# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Co-Scientist project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Fixed the Hugging Face Space build failure by pinning `pydantic` to the
  range required by `gradio[oauth,mcp]==6.19.0`, pinning the Space runtime to
  Python 3.12, and adding a deploy preflight that runs Hugging Face's Gradio
  extras resolver before pushing to the Space.
- Fixed the Hugging Face Space metadata to match the pinned Gradio dependency
  and added post-push Space status polling so build/runtime errors fail the
  deployment workflow instead of being missed (loop#14).

- Automatic model fallback (llnl#26): when the configured/selected model is
  unavailable, delisted, rate-limited, or erroring, `call_llm` falls back to a
  **working free model fetched live from OpenRouter** (`fetch_free_models`, the
  source of truth) instead of failing every run. Falls back on
  model-unavailable / rate-limit / provider errors — not on auth (a different
  model won't help). Rate-limited free models are skipped immediately (SDK
  Retry-After backoff disabled) rather than blocking the run; attempts are
  bounded. A static list is a last resort only if the live fetch fails.
- Updated the default `config.yaml` model (the previous
  `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` was delisted).

### Fixed
- Generation failures no longer surface as a silent empty ranking (llnl#36).
  The real cause — missing/invalid API key, model unavailable/delisted, rate
  limiting, or unparsable model output — now appears in the run status line and
  an actionable error box in the results panel, instead of a false
  "completed successfully". Fixes a three-layer silent-failure chain where the
  error text was discarded during generation, making downstream propagation
  dead code.

### Added
- `classify_llm_error()` maps raw LLM/API errors to user-actionable categories;
  `call_llm` now distinguishes model-unavailable/delisted errors.
- Offline-by-default test suite: `integration`/`network` pytest markers, mocked
  OpenRouter boundary tests, and credential-leak regression tests.
- CI workflow (lint, offline tests, boot smoke) pinned to Python 3.12 with
  CPU-only torch.
- `pyproject.toml` (pytest + ruff config), pinned `requirements.txt`,
  `requirements-dev.txt`, `.env.example`.
- Makefile targets: `test`, `test-all`, `lint`, `fmt`, and per-issue worktree
  helpers `wt`/`wt-clean`.
- `AGENTS.md` (AI-agent instructions), `docs/loop/GOALS.md` (loop steering),
  `scripts/setup_labels.sh` (loop label state machine).

### Fixed
- `call_llm` crashed with openai>=1 when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` was unset instead
  of returning the documented error message.
- API keys are now redacted from log lines and user-facing error text
  (`redact_secrets`).
- `similarity_score` treats whitespace-only input as empty (returns 0.0).

### Removed
- Dead FastAPI-era `tests/test_api.py` (targeted the removed `app/api.py`) and
  the stray `tests/test_graph.html` artifact.
